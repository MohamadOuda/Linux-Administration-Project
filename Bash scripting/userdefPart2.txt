We want to make this script globally reachable (i.e. you can run from anywhere in the system 
without indicating its path, so that we could use “userdef” instead of “./userdef”). 
m) How can we achieve this (2 methods) ? Write the steps to these 2 methods in a text file. 

=> Method 1) We can do so by adding our script to $PATH ( sudo mv userdef /usr/local/bin/ )
=> Method 2) We can also do so by adding its directory to $PATH (echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/home/user/scripts' >> ~/.bashrc)

n) We would like this change to be permanent, how can we do this? 

=> The first Method is permanent the seconf method requires this change to be in .bashrc to be permanent 

o) We just made this change permanent, but we don’t want to wait until another terminal is 
opened, we would like to make this change NOW, and in this terminal. What could we do? 

=> this is only needed for the second method to take effect immediately which is sourcing the bashrc for the change to take effect in same shell (source ~/.bashrc)
